# Salesforce Commerce Cloud CI #

The Salesforce Commerce Cloud CI is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with Commerce Cloud instances from the command line / shell of various operating systems in order to facilitate Continous Integration practices using Commerce Cloud.

## What is this repository for? ##

The focus of the tool is to streamline and easy the communication with Commerce Cloud instances as part of the CI/CD processes. It focuses on the deployment part supporting quality checks such as test execution, not on the quality checks itself.

**Features:**

* Uses Open Commerce APIs completely
* Authentication using Oauth2 only, no Business Manager user needed
* Supported commands include: save state, code activate, site import, reset state
* Configuration of multiple instances
* Aliasing of instances

## How do I get set up? ##

### Prerequisites ###

Ensure you have a valid Open Commerce API client ID set up. You'll need the client ID as well as the client secret. If you don't have a Open Commerce API client ID yet, you can create one using the [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com).

### Configuration ###

In order to perform certain commands the tool provides, you need to give permission to do that on your Commerce Cloud instance(s). You can do that by modifying the Open Commerce API Settings. 

1. Log into the Business Manager
2. Navigate to Administration > Site Development > Open Commerce API Settings
3. Make sure, that you select _Data API_ and _Global_ from the select boxes
4. Add the permission set for your client ID to the settings. 

Use the following snippet as your client's permission set, replace `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` with your client ID:

    {
      "client_id":"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "resources":
      [
        {
          "resource_id":"/code_versions/*",
          "methods":["patch"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/jobs/*/executions",
          "methods":["post"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/jobs/*/executions/*",
          "methods":["get"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        }
      ]
    }
    
Note, if you already have OCAPI Settings configured, e.g. for other clients, add this snippet to the list permission sets for the other clients as follows:

    {
      "_v":"17.7",
      "clients":
      [ 
        {
          ...
        },
        <!-- the new permission set goes here -->
      ]
    }
