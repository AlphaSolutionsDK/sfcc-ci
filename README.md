# Salesforce Commerce Cloud CI #

The Salesforce Commerce Cloud CI is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with Commerce Cloud instances from the command line / shell of various operating systems in order to facilitate Continuous Integration practices using Commerce Cloud. It provides a JavaScript API which can be used to integrate with higher level build tools.

## What is this repository for? ##

The focus of the tool is to streamline and easy the communication with Commerce Cloud instances as part of the CI/CD processes. It focuses on the deployment part supporting quality checks such as test execution, not on the quality checks itself.

**Features:**

* Uses Open Commerce APIs completely
* Authentication using Oauth2 only, no Business Manager user needed
* Supported commands include: save state, code deploy, code activate, site import upload, site import, reset state
* WebDAV connectivity
* Configuration of multiple instances
* Aliasing of instances
* Automatic renewal of Oauth2 token
* Command line client and JavaScript API

## How do I get set up? ##

### Prerequisites ###

Ensure you have a valid Open Commerce API client ID set up. You'll need the client ID as well as the client secret. If you don't have a Open Commerce API client ID yet, you can create one using the [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com).

### Configuration ###

In order to perform certain commands the tool provides, you need to give permission to do that on your Commerce Cloud instance(s). You can do that by modifying the Open Commerce API Settings as well as the WebDAV Client Permissions.

1. Log into the Business Manager
2. Navigate to Administration > Site Development > Open Commerce API Settings
3. Make sure, that you select _Data API_ and _Global_ from the select boxes
4. Add the permission set for your client ID to the settings. 

Use the following snippet as your client's permission set, replace `my_client_id` with your client ID:
```JSON
    {
      "client_id":"my_client_id",
      "resources":
      [
        {
          "resource_id":"/code_versions",
          "methods":["get"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/code_versions/*",
          "methods":["patch"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/jobs/*/executions",
          "methods":["post"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/jobs/*/executions/*",
          "methods":["get"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        }
      ]
    }
```
Note, if you already have OCAPI Settings configured, e.g. for other clients, add this snippet to the list permission sets for the other clients as follows:
```JSON
    {
      "_v":"18.1",
      "clients":
      [ 
        {
          /* ... */
        },
        /* the new permission set goes here */
      ]
    }
```
5. Navigate to Administration >  Organization >  WebDAV Client Permissions
6. Add the permission set for your client ID to the permission settings.

Use the following snippet as your client's permission set, replace `my_client_id` with your client ID:
```JSON
    {
      "client_id":"my_client_id",
      "permissions":
      [
        {
          "path": "/impex",
          "operations": [
            "read_write"
          ]
        },
        {
          "path": "/cartridges",
          "operations": [
            "read_write"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
```
Note, if you already have WebDAV Client Permissions configured, e.g. for other clients, add this snippet to the list permission sets for the other clients as follows:
```JSON
    {
      "clients":
      [ 
        {
          /* ... */
        },
        /* the new permission set goes here */
      ]
    }
```
Note: WebDAV client permission to `cartridges` is available in Commerce Cloud Digital versions greater than **17.8**.

### Configuration ###

sfcc-ci CLI keeps itï¿½s own settings. The location of these settings are OS specific. On Linux they are located at `$HOME/.config/sfcc-ci-nodejs/`, on MacOS they are located at `$HOME/Library/Preferences/sfcc-ci-nodejs/`.

## Using the JavaScript API ##

There is a JavaScript API available, which you can use to program against and integrate the commands into your own project.

Make sfcc-ci available to your project by specifying the dependeny in your `package.json` first and running and `npm install` in your package. After that you require the API into your implementation using:

```javascript
  const sfcc = require('sfcc-ci');
```

The API is structured into sub modules. You may require sub modules directly, e.g.

```javascript
  const sfcc_auth = require('sfcc-ci').auth;
  const sfcc_code = require('sfcc-ci').code;
  const sfcc_instance = require('sfcc-ci').instance;
  const sfcc_job = require('sfcc-ci').job;
  const sfcc_webdav = require('sfcc-ci').webdav;
```

The following APIs are available (assuming `sfcc` refers to `require('sfcc-ci')`):

```javascript
  sfcc.auth.auth(client_id, client_secret, callback);
  sfcc.code.activate(instance, code_version, token, callback);
  sfcc.code.deploy(instance, archive, token, options, callback);
  sfcc.code.list(instance, token, callback);
  sfcc.instance.upload(instance, file, token, options, callback);
  sfcc.instance.import(instance, file_name, token, callback);
  sfcc.job.run(instance, job_id, job_params, token, callback);
  sfcc.job.status(instance, job_id, job_execution_id, token, callback);
  sfcc.webdav.upload(instance, path, file, token, callback);
```

### Authentication ###

APIs available in `require('sfcc-ci').auth`:

`auth(client_id, client_secret, callback)`

Authenticates a clients and attempts to obtain a new Oauth2 token. Note, that tokens should be reused for subsequent operations. In case of a invalid token you may call this method again to obtain a new token.

------------- | ------------| --------------------------------
client_id     | (String)    | The client ID
client_secret | (String)    | The client secret
callback      | (Function)  | Callback function executed as a result. The token and the error will be passed as parameters to the callback function.

**Returns:** (void) Function has no return value

Example:

```javascript
const sfcc = require('sfcc-ci');

var client_id = 'my_client_id';
var client_secret = 'my_client_id';

sfcc.auth.auth(client_id, client_secret, function(token, err) {
    if(token) {
        console.log('Authentication succeeded. Token is %s', token);
    }
    if(err) {
        console.error('Authentication error: %s', err);
    }
});

```
